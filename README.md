Some basic KQLs used for getting most relevant Backup and Replication insights


Some useful KQLs created for customers needing insights into Backup and Replication in Azure Recovery Services Vault for Azure and On-prem resources.

The main idea back those was to compensate for the gap left on the Replication field with introduction of "Backup Reports" functionality in Azure.

KQLs are basic, but insightful, some are better adjusted for visualization of the results - some can do both, and some should be run for raw data.
